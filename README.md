# Hello React Front End

This is a project from the sixth module of the Microverse program. With it, we learned how to build full-stack applications.

This application has `Home` page and a `Greet` page. You can go to the `Greet` by clicking on the link in the `Home` page. Once there, you can generate a greeting by clicking on the `Be greeted` button. Don't be afraid if you get greeted in different languages. That's just the way it works. 😉

## Built With

- React
- Redux
